This isn't really ready for primetime, but here it is.  I'm still developing the plugin, and I created this demo for testing it as I was developing it.  I'm now about to go put it into the real project, which I expect will cause further relatively rapid changes to the plugin, but I will try to bring this demo app up to date as well when possible.

This could use a fair amount of cleanup.  There are piles of commented-out code here, and also some superfluous Javascript files.  I'll clean it up at some point.

Also, there seems to have been some movement in the development of both jqgrid and apotomo since I started putting this together, so this might be mildly out of date.

To make this go

git clone whatever-the-url-is
cd whatever
git submodule init
git submodule update
rake db:migrate
script/server

browse to http://localhost:3000/people/
