This isn't really ready for primetime, but here it is.  I'm still developing the plugin, and I created this demo for testing it as I was developing it.  I'm now about to go put it into the real project, which I expect will cause further relatively rapid changes to the plugin, but I will try to bring this demo app up to date as well when possible.

This could use a fair amount of cleanup.  There are piles of commented-out code here, and also some superfluous Javascript files.  I'll clean it up at some point.

Also, there seems to have been some movement in the development of both jqgrid and apotomo since I started putting this together, so this might be mildly out of date.

To make this go

git clone git://github.com/paulhagstrom/jqGrid_widget_demo.git
cd jqGrid_widget_demo
git submodule init
git submodule update
rake db:migrate
script/server

browse to http://localhost:3000/people/

Dependencies (will be pulled in during the submodule update stage)

There are some symbolic links into these dependencies.  Created by:
in public/images:
ln -s vendor/plugins/jqgrid_widget/public/images/indicator.white.gif
ln -s vendor/plugins/jqgrid_widget/public/javascripts/jqgrid_widget.js
ln -s vendor/plugins/jqgrid_widget/public/stylesheets/jqgrid_widget.css
in public/javascripts:
ln -s jquery-1.4.2.min.js jquery.js
ln -s ../../vendor/plugins/jqGrid/js
ln -s ../../vendor/plugins/jqGrid/jquery.jqGrid.js
ln -s ../../vendor/plugins/jqGrid/js/i18n/grid.locale-en.js

jQuery
This has to be downloaded from jquery.com.  As I write this, it's at 1.4.2.  Put updates in the public/javascripts folder.  There is a symbolic link (jquery.js) to the current version, which needs to be redirected when there is an update.

jQuery UI
This also has to be downloaded, from jqueryui.com.  As I write this, it's at 1.8rc3.  I have made no attempt to minimize the components, maybe sometime I will take an inventory.  I just downloaded the whole thing.  Redmond theme.  I don't know of a github repository.

jqGrid
git://github.com/tonytomov/jqGrid.git
The git source is plugged in with a loader, which makes it easier to keep up to date, but for production, it is probably better to keep it up to date by hand by building it here
http://www.trirand.com/blog/
As I write this, 3.6.4 is available, and I have built it as jquery.jqGrid.min.js.  This does not point into the repository, and will not be updated by git updates, it needs to be fixed by hand.

Non-dependencies:

Prototype
The hope is that I have gotten away from depending on prototype.  This means that controls.js, dragdrop.js, effects.js, and prototype.js should not be needed.
