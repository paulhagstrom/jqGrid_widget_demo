This isn't really ready for primetime, but here it is.  I'm still developing the plugin, and I created this demo for testing it as I was developing it.  I'm now about to go put it into the real project, which I expect will cause further relatively rapid changes to the plugin, but I will try to bring this demo app up to date as well when possible.

TODO list that I know about (for plugin or for demo app)
Filter animations are a bit bumpy
Filter counts: shouldn't they work for superfilters too? (e.g., all?)  They don't.
Filters: check on subfilter includes
Check paging
Selectors: After making a selection with a closed, panel new panel should open? (intended originally)
Selectors: When you cancel, and hide the panel, selectors should revert to none checked.
Selector targets: Some way to indicate that they're dirty?
There is a problem with resource aliases and cell classes. They'll confuse the widget tree if you have two with the same id.
Prefixes don't really work.  A problem with the rendered children?  Somewhere it's a problem.  Maybe I should remove support?


To make this go, clone the demo app, pull in the submodules, create the databases, start the server, populate the database, and explore:

git clone git://github.com/paulhagstrom/jqGrid_widget_demo.git
cd jqGrid_widget_demo
git submodule init
git submodule update
rake db:migrate
script/server
browse to http://localhost:3000/degrees/populate
later
browse to http://localhost:3000/degrees/
browse to http://localhost:3000/people/

There are a couple of different levels of complexity here available for testing.

The most basic screen is programs, just allows editing of a lookup table.

http://localhost:3000/programs/

Only slightly more complex is degrees, which has popup menus referring to sections and programs, and demonstrates the use of custom column renderers.

http://localhost:3000/degrees/

One step more complicated is the employees screen, which has a child table.  When there is just one record, the child table doesn't expand, only displays.

http://localhost:3000/employees/

The most complex is people, with many interactions

http://localhost:3000/people/

Dependencies are listed below.  Many are installed as git submodules, which will be pulled in at the git submodule update stage above.  To make updating easier, most of the UI stuff is symbolically linked into the public/ directory.  The symbolic links were created as follows:

in public/images:
ln -s vendor/plugins/jqgrid_widget/public/images/indicator.white.gif
ln -s vendor/plugins/jqgrid_widget/public/javascripts/jqgrid_widget.js
ln -s vendor/plugins/jqgrid_widget/public/stylesheets/jqgrid_widget.css

in vendor/plugins:
ln -s jquery.jqGrid-3.6.4 jqGrid
ln -s jquery-ui-1.8rc3.custom/ jquery-ui

in public/javascripts:
ln -s ../../vendor/plugins/jquery-ui/js/jquery-1.4.2.min.js jquery.js
ln -s ../../vendor/plugins/jquery-ui/js/jquery-ui-1.8rc3.custom.min.js jquery-ui.js

ln -s ../../vendor/plugins/jquery.form/jquery.form.js
ln -s ../../vendor/plugins/jrails/javascripts/jrails.js

in public/stylesheets:

ln -s ../../vendor/plugins/jquery-ui/css/redmond jquery-ui

The dependencies themselves:

jQuery
This can be downloaded from jquery.com.  As I write this, it's at 1.4.2.  Put updates in the public/javascripts folder.  There is a symbolic link (jquery.js) to the current version, which needs to be redirected when there is an update.  I have opted to point the symbolic link at the version that comes with jQuery UI, however.

jQuery UI
This also has to be downloaded, from jqueryui.com.  As I write this, it's at 1.8rc3.  I have made no attempt to minimize the components, maybe sometime I will take an inventory.  I just downloaded the whole thing.  Redmond theme.  I don't know of a github repository.
Installed into vendor/plugins, with symbolic links.  There is a symbolic link (jquery-ui) to the current version, which needs to be redirected when there's an update.
The theme setup seems less good than before, everything seems more integrated, harder to download just the theme files.  For now, the symbolic link in public/stylesheets will force redmond.

jqGrid
git://github.com/tonytomov/jqGrid.git
The git source is plugged in with a loader, which makes it easier to keep up to date, but for production, it is probably better to keep it up to date by hand by building it here
http://www.trirand.com/blog/
As I write this, 3.6.4 is available, and I have built it as jquery.jqGrid.min.js.  This does not point into the repository, and will not be updated by git updates, it needs to be fixed by hand.  There is an alias jqGrid in vendor/plugins that points to the current jqGrid directory.

jrails
git://github.com/aaronchi/jrails.git
I decided it's easier to just go ahead and use this.

TableDnD
http://www.isocra.com/2008/02/table-drag-and-drop-jquery-plugin/
Install in public/javascripts directly, not version controlled
http://code.google.com/p/tablednd/
Current version afaik is 0.5.

jQuery Form
http://malsup.com/jquery/form/
git://github.com/malsup/form.git
Added as a submodule, git will update

jqGrid_widget
git://github.com/paulhagstrom/jqGrid_widget.git
Added as a submodule, git will update

apotomo
git://github.com/apotonick/apotomo.git
Added as a submodule, git will update

cells
git://github.com/apotonick/cells.git
Now using gem, current version 3.3.4


Non-dependencies:

Prototype
The hope is that I have gotten away from depending on prototype.  This means that controls.js, dragdrop.js, effects.js, and prototype.js should not be needed.
